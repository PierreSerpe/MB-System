The MB-System source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License,

were described as "public domain", which meant there was no restriction
whatsoever on the use of the code. For over a decade we have adopted the
more restrictive GNU GPL license in order to insure that anyone who distributes
software based in whole or in part on MB-System also distributes their
modified MB-System source code and any additional source code.

The file "GPL.md", also located at the top of the MB-System source code
distribution directory structure, contains the text of the GNU GPL version 3.

The MB-System distribution includes some source code derived from packages that
are distributed separately and have been authored by programmers other than the
MB-System team. This includes:

* The Generic Sensor Format (GSF) library source located in mbsystem/src/gsf. 
  The GSF package is maintained and distributed by Leidos Corporation under 
  contract to the United States Naval Oceanographic Office. The current GSF 
  source distribution is made available by Leidos at 
    https://www.leidos.com/products/ocean-marine#gsf 
  using the LGPLv2.1 license.
* The SURF API (SAPI) library source located in mbsystem/src/surf. The SAPI 
  package was released under the GNU General Public License by Atlas Hydrographic 
  in 2001.
* The MR1PR library source located in mbsystem/src/mr1pr. This package was openly 
  released by primary author Roger Davis of the Hawaii Mapping Research Group in 2000.
* The mb_mergesort() function found in mbsystem/src/mbio/mb_esf.c derives from the 
  GNU-Darwin Distribution. This code is released under both the Apple Public Source 
  License Version 1.1 and the BSD license, with original copyright by the Regents
